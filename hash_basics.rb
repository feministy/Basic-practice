#hash basics
#elements of a hash are identified by name, not position (essentially unordered lists)
#don't understand "first element", but they do understand "element named Frank"
#
#
#syntax: variable {value}
#
#example
person = {:first_name => 'Frank', :last_name => 'Hardy', :age => 25}
#symbols :first_name, :last_name, :age are called keys
#access specific elements of a hash through their keys
