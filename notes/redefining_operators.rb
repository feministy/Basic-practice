# We've learned about a handful of standard Ruby operators/methods
# (1) mathematical
# (2) boolean: <, >, ==
# (3) conversion: to_i, to_f, etc

# Different methods mean different things
# depending on what they are paired with

# Example:
# + means integer addition when we're talking with Fixnums
5 + 4 # => 9

# But it means 

# We can change the meaning of operators for our own custom classes
