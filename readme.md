###Hello!  
Welcome to my first attempts at Ruby. Most of the exercises and notes are from the following sources:

* The Dev Bootcamp training platform (Socrates)
* _Learn How to Program_ by Chris Pine
* _Learn Ruby the Hard Way_ by Zed Shaw
* _The Well-Grounded Rubyist_ by David Black   
  
Additionally, I've taken the knowledge learned through the first two sources listed and created some smaller programs of my own. Namely a knitting hat generator and a basic measurement conversion tool, both of which are unfinished.   
  
There are a few exercises from various sources on the web that produce finished programs, such as my encryption tool. The sources are listed in the first few lines of each file.
