###Hello!  
Welcome to my first attempts at Ruby.  
_Outside of modeling the other kind at a jewelry store._  
  
Everything you see here is a basic exercise from the Dev Bootcamp training platform (Socrates) or _Learn How to Program_ by Chris Pine. I'm also practicing on mixing things together from Ruby docs. Mostly strings, because I'm not that far along yet.
