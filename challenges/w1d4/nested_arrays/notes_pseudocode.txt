PIECES:

(1) keys == table[0][0-4]
Each element from table[0] should become a key in EACH subhash.

(2) values == table[1-5][0-4]
Each element from the subarray should be assigned to the keys.

BASIC IDEA IN NORMAL HUMAN

table[0][0] is the key for table[1][0], table [2][0], etc
table[0][1] is the key for table[1][1], table [2][1], etc

To build the hash in the right order, we need to:
1. Make a hash
2. Add a key, followed by its value
3. Repeat 2 until completed
4. Increment a counter

USE A LOOP!

Create a new nested table called hashed_data_table

while next_array > table.length+1
  new_hash = {}
  next_array = 1

    while next_index > table[0.length+1]
      next_index = 0

      new_hash[table[0][next_index]] = (table[next_array][next_index)]
      next_index += 1
    end

    hashed_data_table << new_hash 

    next_array += 1
    new_hash = {}
end
